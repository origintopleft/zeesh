## a custom zsh environment

### What's it do?
* Provides a unique syntax for running ssh sessions. You can simply type `command@target-host --args` to run a one shot command on target-host (or `@target-host` to open a full ssh session)
* Customizes the prompt according to developer's personal preferences (framework for customization coming soon!)
* Automatically updates itself, and is capable of installing itself with just a stub zshrc
* Support for some developer environment tools, such as OPAM and conda
* And more, as needed!
